Bruce's core implementation was written by Dave Peterson (GitHub ID
dspeterson).  Bruce also contains code written by former Tagged employees who
worked on the [Stig Database Project](http://www.stigdb.org/).  These
contributors include Jason Lucas, Joris Van Remoortere, Cody Maloney,
Michael Park, Chris Tidder, Deanna Rubin, and Joshua Ball.  The former Stig
Team has since formed its own company, [OrlyAtomics](http://orlyatomics.com/).
